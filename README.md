WP Frontend Profile gives you the ability to add a extensible user profile section to the frontend of your WordPress website. By default the plugin adds two tabs to the frontend profile. One of these tabs, titled profile, allows a user to edit their user data including email, first and last names, URL and bio (description). The password tab allows a user to change their password for the site.

### Features of the plugin include:

*	Frontend user profile
*	Frontend user registration
*	Frontend user login
*	User emails
*	Developer friendly with dozens of actions and filters
*   Added Login Widget
*   Addon for Mailchimp
*   Added Content Restriction feature for paid members.

### Plugin Extensibility

As the frontend profile is rendered with tabs you can easily add your own tabs with your own fields to store user meta data. Tabs and fields are added through filters and all the saving of the data is taken care of for you.

You can add the following field types:

*	WYSIWYG
*	Select
*   Multi Select
*   Radio
*	Text Area
*	Checkbox
*	Password
*	Email
*	Text

See [FAQs](https://github.com/glowlogix/wp-frontend-profile/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions) for how to add our own fields and tabs.
